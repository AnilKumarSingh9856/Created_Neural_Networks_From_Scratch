# Building Neural Networks from Scratch

This project is a hands-on guide to understanding the inner workings of neural networks by implementing them step-by-step using Python and NumPy. It aims to demystify core deep learning concepts without relying on high-level frameworks.

This project is heavily inspired by and follows the structure of the book ["Neural Networks from Scratch in Python"](https://nnfs.io/) by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukie≈Ça. The code here represents my personal implementation and notes as I work through the book.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Why build from scratch?

By building a neural network from the ground up, you will gain a deeper understanding of:

- **Forward Propagation**: How input data flows through the network.
- **Activation Functions**: The role they play in introducing non-linearity.
- **Layers**: How to structure and connect layers of neurons.
- **Batch Processing**: How to process data efficiently in batches.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnilKumarSingh9856/Created_Neural_Networks_From_Scratch.git
    cd Created_Neural_Networks_From_Scratch
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure and Usage

This project is organized into the following files and directories:

-   `NNFS_Chapter_2_Coding_Our_First_Neurons.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that serves as the entry point to the project. It walks you through coding a single neuron, then a full layer of neurons, and demonstrates the efficiency gains of using NumPy for these operations.

-   `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python packages required to run the project. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

-   `LICENSE`: Contains the MIT License under which this project is shared.

-   `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview of the project.
