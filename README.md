# Building Neural Networks from Scratch

Welcome to "Building Neural Networks from Scratch"! This project is a hands-on guide to understanding the inner workings of neural networks by implementing them step-by-step using Python and NumPy.

The goal is to demystify core deep learning concepts like forward propagation, layers, and batch processing without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python and the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnilKumarSingh9856/Created_Neural_Networks_From_Scratch.git
    cd Created_Neural_Networks_From_Scratch
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ðŸ“– Usage

The project is structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks. You can explore the concepts by opening and running the cells in the following notebook:

-   **`NNFS_Chapter_2_Coding_Our_First_Neurons.ipynb`**: This notebook walks you through the process of coding a single neuron, then a full layer of neurons, and finally processing batches of data using both plain Python and NumPy for efficiency.
